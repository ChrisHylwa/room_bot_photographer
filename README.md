Don't forget to run a `catkin_make` after getting this onto the Turtlebot terminals.

Should be able to run this using `roslaunch photographer photographer.launch`.

If not, run the python code in the scripts folder using `rosrun`.

I'm not sure if the actual package works at the moment, but the python is almost certainly correct. If any bugs end up showing up, let me know ASAP so I can fix them.

Note - USB Cam feature is still not implemented in this current build, so make sure to use the digital camera and save those images seperately
