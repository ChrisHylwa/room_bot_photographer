Make sure to run the python file itself (using `rosrun`)! I'm not sure if the actual package works at the moment, but the python is almost certainly correct. If any bugs end up showing up, let me know ASAP so I can fix them.

Note - USB Cam feature is still not implemented in this current build, so make sure to use the digital camera and save those images seperately
